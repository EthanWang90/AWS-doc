pipeline:
    1. ssh connection
    2. promote self to root user by sudo su
    3. in order to connect with aws services or resources, we need to run "aws configure" to add credentials with key id and secret key
    4. try to create a s3 bucket by "aws s3 mb s3://bucketnameinlowercase"

how to access s3 or other services from ec2 without providing private id and key?:
    1. we need to create a role that has the specific permission we want and attach it to our ec2 instance
    2. we also need to delete our previously input key in our Linux hiding fold "~/.aws"
