Two deployment approaches:
    1. In-Place(only support ec2, not support lambda)
    2. Blue/Green

Deployment group: A set of ec2 instances or lambda functions to which a new revision of the software is to be deployed.
AppSpec File: Defines the deployment actions you want AWS CodeDeploy to execute
codedeploy can deploy to lambda

Lab Pipeline:
    1. Create an Ec2 which has the access to our s3 bucket where the code is stored.
        1.1 attche access s3 role to ec2
        1.2 give ec2 instance a tag
        1.3 login ec2 via ssh
    2. Install code deploy agent on to our EC2 instance.
    3. Use CodeDeploy to deploy a simple web app to our ec2.
        3.1 create role for CodeDeploy to make api calls and give permission to install applications on your ec2 instance.
        3.2 turn local machine to developer machine which means add aws user to local machine, give the user s3 access and codedeploy access.
        3.3 create appspec.yml file to configure; create script folder to store scripts which will be executed during deployment
        3.4 create application.zip in project folder using aws deploy command
        3.5 push application to s3
        3.6 configure deployment group inside codedeploy console
        3.7 create deployment
