the object in s3 is immidiately readable when you first create it(read consistency)
but update object will cost time for aws to propagate the data, which is not immidiately readable

By default, newly create buckets are private. Until it is set to public

bucket policies: for bucket level
access control lists: for object level

we can create s3 bucket access logs to record the access activities, and we can also store the logs to another bucket.

with server side bucket encryption policy, any object willing to "put" into s3 bucket must have a specific header:
    x-amz-server-side-encryption:AES256; or 
    x-amz-server-side-encryption:ams:kms
or the put request will be denied.

object is between 0~5TB, but a single Put upload could only be 5GB at most
s3 use key name to determine which partition the file will be stored in

use s3 signed urls to give resource limit access time.
